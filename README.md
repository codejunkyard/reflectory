    Insight: AI-Powered Article Analysis

# The "Insight" Service Overview
Insight provides AI-powered article analysis, evaluating key aspects of an article's origin, credibility, and intent.
Core Functionality

    AI-driven content analysis to assess news articles, blog posts, and online publications.
    Evaluation criteria include:
        Source authenticity – Identifies the original publisher and its credibility.
        Author verification – Determines whether the author is human or AI-generated.
        Bias assessment – Detects political, ideological, or corporate biases.
        Authenticity check – Verifies factual accuracy and editorial integrity.
        Deepfake detection – Flags AI-generated or manipulated content.
        Scam and misinformation filtering – Identifies fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive content.
        Advertisement recognition – Detects embedded sponsored content or hidden ads.

Scoring System

    Each characteristic is assigned a quantifiable score, providing a clear breakdown of an article’s reliability.
    Scores are presented in an intuitive format, helping users quickly assess an article's trustworthiness.

Optimized Storage & Reusability

To improve efficiency, the system checks for existing analysis results before performing a new evaluation:

    Local Storage – Checks the device cache for previously analyzed articles.
    Remote Shared Storage – Queries a global database to prevent redundant AI processing.
    AI Analysis – If no prior analysis exists, the AI evaluates the article and stores the results for future use.
    Storage Updates – New analyses are saved in both local and remote storage for quick retrieval.
